Only int type data is provided to the BidirectionalIterators, thus the return type of its next() and previous() is 'int'.

Since the sample input shows that the BidirectionalIterators is an array, thus in the ApplicationClass initiates it as a BidirectionalIterators[] datatype. It could have been improved if the List<> is used to store the bidirectional iterators.

The next() and previous() work in circular manner, however, the hasNext() and hasPrevious() do not. For example, 
--> the given List is {1,2,3}
--> calling next() when the index is pointing at element 3, it returns 1. Similarly for previous()
--> calling hasNext() when the index is pointing at element 3, return flase. Similarly for hasPrevious().
